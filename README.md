## ✅ Approach 1 — Basic useState

### 📂 Folder: `approach-1/`

This approach uses a single component (`App.jsx`) where:
- Background color is controlled via `useState`
- Buttons are rendered directly inside the component
- Color is updated by directly calling `setBgColor('color')`

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- React Hooks: `useState`
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Inline dynamic styles for background

### ▶️ How to Run:

```bash
cd approach-1
npm install
npm run dev
